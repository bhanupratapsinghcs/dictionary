# DICTIONARY IN PYTHON

Dependcies:
```
import json
import difflib
```
### I created six different clones and one final **Dictionary file**
- dict1.py
> A simple code that just loads the data stored in json format into dictionary format in Python
- dict2.py
> Check for non-existing words
- dict3.py
> Case sensitivity
- dict4.py
> Use *'difflib'* in our code to get the closest match
- dict5.py
> If the suggested word is what user wants, get the meaning.
- dict6.py
> If the word has more than one meaning, print them in new lines
- dict3-1.py
> Using two different methods **'SequenceMatcher'** and **'get_close_matches'** from *'difflib'*
### And finally the comple code 
`dictionaryFinal.py`
